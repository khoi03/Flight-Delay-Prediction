# Flight-Delay-Prediction
In this research, we have utilized a range of machine learning algorithms, such as Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN), in combination with data augmentation technique (ADASYN) and Bayesian Optimization to enhance prediction accuracy.
